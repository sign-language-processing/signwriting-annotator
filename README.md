# SignWriting Annotator

This project aims to transcribe in SignWriting a large vocabulary of single-sign videos in various signed languages.

## Intermediate Goal

Allow the matching of existing entries in SignBank to videos in SpreadTheSign.
This should be less time-consuming than transcription from scratch, and should allow a baseline transcription system to be developed.

## End Goal

For every video (in the database, or uploaded), the system should predict a transcription, which could be followed by human post-editing.
